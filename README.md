I'm **Tim Josephson**, a post-doctoral researcher at University College Dublin in the [Developmental Biomechanics lab](https://developmental-biomechanics.org/). 
My research focuses on skeletal tissues and understanding the role of mechanical stimulus in skeletal development, fracture healing, and remodeling. 
I develop tools, primarily in Python, for computational modeling to support this research, especially code for mesh generation and simulation frameworks. 

I earned my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Boston University, working in the [Skeletal Mechanobiology and Biomechanics Lab](https://morganresearchlab.org/).
